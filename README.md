üåê UPSTUDY : BEST PLATFORM TO EMPOWER SKILLS 

This project is a online course platform built using a pre-designed front-end template with added custom features and a functional backend. 

This project was created in my earlier learning stages where I was learning to build a full-stack web application using the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS and many more. 

The project is a simple online course platform which was created to explore the working of PHP service and MySQL database. Providing the ability to store the data of users and retrieve them based on administrative priviledges.
